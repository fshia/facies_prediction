# Evaluation of various machine learning methods on lithological facies prediction for reservoir characterization

## Introduction
Three machine learning methods are applied to evaluate the accuracy on lithological facies classification and prediction for reservoir characterization. The public well logging dataset provided by [SEG](http://www.seg.org) are used in this project. The training dataset have ten wells with a set of nine variables as the predictors and one variable rock facies as the outcome. The validation dataset consist two wells that have the same predictors as the training dataset.

Three supervised learning models are applied in this project.
