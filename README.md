# Comparison of various machine learning methods on lithological facies prediction for reservoir characterization

## Introduction
Three machine learning methods are applied to evaluate the accuracy on lithological facies classification and prediction for reservoir characterization. The public well logging dataset provided by [SEG](http://www.seg.org) are used in this project.
